## Description of App

A simple party game that pits two randomly created fighters against each other. It is up to you and your friends to pick who you think will win!

You can also play variations of this game by changing how you are judging each fighter. Maybe which one you would rather fight; Maybe the cooler one; Maybe just at random; the choice is yours

## Development

Developed this app to practice with Flutter and Dart. I learned how to develop an Android app, designing both the visuals and the code to control the flow. Worked with saving data to the local storage, adding banner ads, and taking payments through Google Play Api. I learned the process of publishing an app to the play store, understanding what it took.
